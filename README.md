# Social Activism Platform - Rebutify

Rebutify is a website for activists to collaboratively optimize responses to anti-[social movement] arguments. 
Rebutifyâ€™s first versions focus on smaller communities such as veganism and plans expansion into other movements. I am contributing to the backend development with Python and Django and collaborating with two other developers.
